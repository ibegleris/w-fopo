    "#### Points of interest:\n",
    "Fistly on the outside the fibre propagation will be the only part that is changed from the FOPO code. In specifics:\n",
    "* We will cut the fibre in to small pieces that have constant fibre parameters over the length of propagation. \n",
    "* Sequentially use the NLSE on those parts for varrying: Dispersion, Effective area and maybe ??polarisation??. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main parameter that will cause the variation is the radius in a step-index fibre:\n",
    "* The standard deviation of the radius is quoted as 1% in [Four-wave mixing in fibers with randomly varying zero-dispersion wavelength] which also quotes 0.02% in the refractive index difference.\n",
    "* From the std of this we can consider the dispersion and effective area\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polarisation\n",
    "* One thing that should be addressed is the polarisation of the beam\n",
    "* While the theory behind [Intermodal Four-Wave-Mixing and Parametric Amplification in km-long Fibers] can be applied to the fibre propagation there is the thought of keeping that vector identity for the next round oscillation since there will be a difference in the dirrection of the field.\n",
    "    * We can either apply a polarisation controller on the field before meeting the next round\n",
    "    * Keep the dirrection of the field in memory ie move to a vector identity\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### After a talk with Peter on the subject:\n",
    "    * We could consider a two-mode (LP01a and LP01b) from the multimode equation instead.\n",
    "    * additionally we would work on the WDM's that would operate independent of polarisation. But to also release two different polarisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Update:\n",
    "    * I have expanded the code to include two mode gnlse. This way we consider the two polarisations as two modes of the MMGLSE\n"

    "##### Points:\n",
    "* Regadless of what happens to the fibre it MUST stay single mode throughout the spectrum considered. \n",
    "* Testing will happen upon the data given by the LPMA fibre since we know allot about how it behaves. After this we can consider another fibre. \n",
